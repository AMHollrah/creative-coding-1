        This is Anna Hollrah's pixel project that I did again, but challenged myself
        to add more photos to create a collage

        All of these pictures taken in Seattle Washington a few summers ago at 
        Point Defiance Park in the Rose Garden

        I chose to use the ellipse this time with my pixels instead of the text
        because I wanted to keep the photo close to the orginial, but more artsy. 

        I played around with the var r,g,b but in the end I left those alone for my final version
