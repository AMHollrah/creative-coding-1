    <title>Quilt Pattern</title> 
    <!--
        Use this page to complete the "Quilt Pattern" exercise:
        https://canvas.umw.edu/courses/1446087/assignments/10969847

        This is My (Anna Hollrah) 2nd intreptation in adding
        another if/else to change the pattern of the quilt and 
        adding in another color for a unique pattern

        This came from the example of the squares pattern which has alot 
        of varitions and unfortantly, I was not able to find this pattern 
        on the website that shows an example of what I created, in 8 squares
        showcase the 9th center saqure. This one is close
