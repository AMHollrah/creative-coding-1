    <title>Circle Grid</title> 
    <!--
        Use this page to complete the "Circle Grid" exercise:

        This is my (Anna Hollrah) Circle Grid for Exercise 2.2
        I added in the stroke and fill to change the colors and I also changed
        up the strokeWeight until I got the outline thickness of 8
        
        I also removed the { from the end of 10 in the orginial code 
        because there was an error code

        I changed the width of the ellipse to 150 and the height to 125 to 
        give the circles a patterned effect in layering on top of each other
