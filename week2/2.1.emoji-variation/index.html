        This is my (Anna Hollrah) recreation of the purple heart emoji
        https://emojipedia.org/purple-heart/

        I used the code in the 2nd resource below and tweaked the curvevertex
        until I came up with the a heart that was less pointy and squished.

        I also went tried several fill colors until I found the purple shade
