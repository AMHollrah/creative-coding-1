        This is Anna Hollrah's pixel project for Week 2

        This picture I chose of the pink rose is from my own personal images
        taken in Seattle Washington a few summers ago at Point Defiance Park

        I chose to use text instead of a shpae to create alittle more dimension
        and I liked how the word rose overlaped itself like the petals of a rose,
        so I didn't space the text out from itself

        I played around with he r,g,b to remove or add color contrast until 
        I liked the final version of colors - looks better from a distance
