        This is my (Anna Hollrah) variation in changing the shape to a quad
        and changing the points of each vertex until I created two triangles
        facing each other with the last y4 at 80
        
        I didn't like how looked random created the strokeWeight, so I kept it at 5

        I also removed the { from the end of 10 in the orginial code 
        because there was an error code
