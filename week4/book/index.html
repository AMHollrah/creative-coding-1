        This is Anna Hollrah's version of the "book project" using Example 3
        Tracery Grammar.
        
        I kept the number, but updated the rest of the grammar by adding color and 
        mood to adj, animal, and verb. I also changed all the adj, animal, and verbs
        to create a silly book about animals in the ocean. 
        
        I updated the sentance to include two animals and what they were doing in the ocean
        and I changed the chapter and book title to included color and adj to make them 
        fit the theme of the "book".
