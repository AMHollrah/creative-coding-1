    <title>Final Project</title> 
    <!--
        Artist Statement by Anna Hollrah
            As I was looking through the final project ideas – I was a little intimidated by the examples as they
            seemed way beyond what we had learned in the past 4 weeks. I researched each of them, but I kept coming 
            back to the Generative Landscape ideas, so I delved a little further into researching these kinds of designs 
            and what had been created. I came across Let It Snow with Perlin Noise in p5.js
            https://www.javascript.christmas/2020/16 and got a little inspiration and after reading through 
            the whole article, I figured I could probably try and create some type of landscape. I came up with an 
            underwater scene in my mind that I could add some freepik underwater animals too for the images, but 
            that isn’t quite what happened. 

            I started watching the Perlin Noise videos from The Coding Trains series and begin playing around with the code 
            and created a looping one line of noise, but I couldn’t figure out how to create another line and keep the 
            loop running. After reaching out to Professor Whalen for help, he was able to figure out that I just need to 
            copy my first line and add a 1 to all the x and y coordinates. I was then able to create line 3 and 4 by 
            just rewriting the same code and changing the numbers on x and y along with adding more height. 

            To add color from the top of the noise line to the bottom, I had to change the vertex shape to a 
            line shape and added two more coordinates to fill in the color all the way to the bottom of canvas.
            As I was doing this, I realized, this was looking more like a mountain landscape scene then an underwater 
            scene, so I switched gears with my colors and background. I created two layers of line and shaded them in 
            differnt greens for the forest with several layers of blues behind the greens to look like the Blue 
            Ridge Mountains.  I added a circle for a sun and then added in code to move it on the y axis. 
            
            I was really happy with how everything turned out, but I was struggling a little bit with my background. 
            I researching how to do a gradient sky in p5js to see if that would complete the landscape 
            when I came across a code by skgmmt in the p5js editor (link is in the sketch.js code) that moved 
            the sun and moon on the y axis along with changing the background as the moon and sun went through 
            the sky. I made some changes to the code and added it my background layer. I did slow it down quite 
            a bit, but it seems more life like and not a fast moving motion. I also feel like the slow motion, 
            creates an angle visual affect and the sun and moon seem to move through the sky at an angle from the 
            mountains, but it just a very cool optical illusion.
