        I revised my quilt pattern to challenge myself and create the quilt I had 
        linked in another version on week 2

        I added another rectangle, but took away the rotate feature and centered it
        on top of my other rotated sqaures and updated the colors to match with each
        other and the border - it seems simplistic, but I couldn't figure out how to 
        do this the first time, so I challenged myself to figure it out for my portfolio.
