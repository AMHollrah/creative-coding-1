        This is Anna Hollrah code for the bounce exercise using the rose picture
        I changed my background and dimension of the image until it was sized right,
        and changed up the speed of x and y to hit the edges exactly

        body {
            background-color:#6d4153;

        main {
            width: 100%;
        }
