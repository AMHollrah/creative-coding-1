        This is Anna Hollrah representation of Time in a fun and unique way. 
        I love flowers and as I was thinking through this project, I knew I wanted to
        include flowers in some way to represent the hour, minute, and second, but I 
        wasn't certain which flower to use. As I was searching through some images of flowers
        that represent "time in some way" (Four O'clocks, Moonflower, Passion Flower etc.) I 
        came across the sunflower and knew it would be perfect. Sunflowers in a way are their very
        own sundial - they track the sun with their blossoms from the sun rising in the east and then 
        through out the day until the sun set sets in the west. They are often associated with harvest 
        in the fall, reminding us that seasons come and go. Another side (which I didn't know) is that they also
        represent life and death - as the vine and blossom grow taller it represents life, but as it wilts and fades
        it shows the passing of time coming to a close. 

        I used the background image of a field of sunflowers to represent all of our lives, we may each be different, but
        we are each given the same hours in the days represented by the sunflowers in the sky, moving from left to right
        the smaller sunflower represents the seconds, the middle size represents the minutes and the larger sunflower on 
        the top represents the hour. I found sunflowers in various stages of bloom to show how the seconds grow into the
        hours. I also centered the Day at the top of the sky to show us that we each are given the day before us, how we
        spend out hours, minutes, and seconds is each up to us.
